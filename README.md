**Sample One**: Abstract Sample <br/>
<p>Accumulation of water runoff during rain storms affects New York City’s combination water system, forcing water treatment plants to release untreated excess water. Rather than allow this grey water to overfill the sewer system, pocket parks and gardens can be used to absorb rainfall. By harnessing nature’s resources through today’s technology we can also create solar and rain catching canopies to beautify, educate, and bring growth and social awareness to local businesses. </p>
<p>In order to design the canopies to collect the maximum amount of rainwater and maximize solar collection, we analyzed expected rainfall and optimal solar angles. The canopies will provide shade for benches near existing flower beds, collect rainwater for irrigation, and collect solar energy. Rainwater that falls on the canopy will slope into PVC pipes and be distributed to clay pots which will efficiently distribute water, while solar panels will provide energy for public electrical outlets. The inclusion of a solar panel created the need for an energy storage component, especially in the absence of sunlight, which quantitatively measures the harnessed energy, and a solar charge controller for energy regulation to limit the rate at which electric current will be added or drawn from the battery and distribution.  
Upon completion of the first prototype using mostly wooden and plywood materials, the density of the canopy shade proved to be top heavy thereby making the overall structure singly unstable posing safety concern, this necessitated a proposed material change into aluminum and canvas with lighter weight as a possible standalone and/or adaptive structure to the existing pocket parks. Once refined, these canopies can provide shade, public electrical outlets, and help to mitigate New York City’s storm water runoff problem.</p>

**Sample Three**: Hardware Security
The focus of this text is on a layout-level Integrated Circuit Camouflaging – this technique addresses how to deter reverse engineering attacks on IC by using camouflaged cells that are similar and mimics any number of Boolean functions. Previously known techniques have already been broken through a de-camouflaging approach, that uses Boolean satisfiability technique to compute specialized discriminating input patterns that reduces the functionality search space quickly. CamoPerturb is the countermeasure proposed to counter this weakness by utilizing logic perturbation with IC; it does this by adding/removing one minterm as opposed to camouflaging the design.  Another box CamoFix restores the perturbed minterm to recover the designs functionality. This report postulates formal proofs for securing CamoPerturb.
<p>The loss in billions through intellectual property piracy is enabled by the ability to reverse engineer integrated circuits which is done by depackaging, delayering, imaging of the individual layers, annotating the images, and extracting the netlist which is the motivation behind this report. IC Camouflaging is done by inserting false contacts, filler cells, programmable standard cells, or any variation thereof. The main proposed solution is to apply a simple transformation to a given design and then modify the functionality instead of concealing it – this method is called minterm perturbation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of CamoPerturb, the experiments were conducted on ISCAS’85 benchmark circuits & OpenSPARC controllers microprocessor. Available camouflaged gate selections techniques are weak against the DeCamo attack because they fail to account for the discriminating ability of inputs; while CamoPerturb complicates the attack by restricting an attacker to eliminate at most a single incorrect assignment per discriminating input through hiding the responses of the original to one minterm. This makes CamoPerturb effective against reverse engineering. </p>
